  <p dir="auto">Hi there! I'm Khuong, a web developer. This series, <b>React Projects For Beginner</b>, was created to share my knowledge and experience with you when I study ReactJS at <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/">here</a>. In this series, you'll learn how to build simple, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, ReactJS.</p>
  <p dir="auto">Each project in this series is started from scratch, finished without using copied code and has a live link to see a result. Then, we'll go over the code together to ensure that everyone understands. </p>
  <p>I hope you can find something which is helpful for you.</p>
  <p>I'll add more projects in future.</p>
